                <h1>Dog behaviour ?</h1>
                <p class="description">
                    <h6> Person approaches you, what do you do when your dog growls?</h6>
                    In no case do I lecture my dog, who has just told me that the person approaching us makes him uncomfortable, or even frightened. By growling, he is also warning the person who should not advance towards him and turn his head away. The handler should calm
                    the dog and divert his attention by moving away slightly and calmly without pulling on the lead. He can then begin to anticipate and positively associate the approach of strangers. Ignore the stranger's snide comments if they challenge
                    you about your behaviour towards your dog. The growl is the final warning before the snarl or the chattering of teeth that precedes the bite. To inhibit this behaviour is to expose yourself to serious accidents, especially for children
                    who are familiar with the dog.

                        <h6>What games do you play with your dog? </h6> During specific interactions with humans through play (ball throwing, tugging, etc.), the dog benefits. It develops a bond with its master and spends time. Play has a positive impact
                        on the dog, the human and their relationship: multiplying the positive experiences between them makes it possible to create a real bond. You can also play intellectual games (e.g. searching for treats in a small drawer) with your
                        dog, encouraging him when he is on the right track to solve the problem. It is important to vary the games and their level of difficulty.
                        <h6> What do you do when your dog is very scared? </h6> The handler can channel the dog’s attention and possibly offer a game if the dog is able to communicate with him. If the dog is very frightened, the handler van stroke the dog
                        to soothe it. Avoid confronting the dog with too much anxiety. If he is afraid of a noise or a situation, let him experience it from a distance while playing with him so that he associates the noise or the situation with a positive
                        action and contact. Then gradually move closer to the source of the anxiety over the course of the sessions.
                        <h6> What do you do when another dog approaches your dog? </h6> You observe the postures of each dog before deciding whether they can make contact if neither dog expresses a threat. If not, get your dog's attention and turn around or
                        walk away from the other dog. It is important to be aware of your dog's safety zone so that you do not put him under stress.
                        <h6> Can a sleeping dog be disturbed without warning?</h6> No. You cannot disturb a dog during its sleeping period. Humans must respect their dog's sleeping time. It is better to warn the dog or to call the dog.

                <h1>The Border Collie</h1>
                <p class="description">The Border Collie dog breed was developed to gather and control sheep in the hilly border country between Scotland and England. They are known for their intense stare, or eye with which they control their flock.
                    <br>They are dogs with unlimited energy, stamina, and working drive, all of which make them a premier herding dog. Border Collies are still used today to herd sheep on farms and ranches around the world. Even though these are purebred
                    dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups.<br> Remember to adopt. Don t shop if you want to bring a dog home. The highly trainable and intelligent, Border Collies also excel in various canine sports, including
                    obedience, flyball, agility, tracking, and flying disc competitions. <br>They can make for great family companions, so long as they get a lot of physical and mental exercise. You ll also have to be comfortable with a dog who can outsmart
                    you from time to time. If you want a loving, brainy dog who will keep you active and on your toes, this may be the breed for you.</p>

                <h1>The Shetland Sheepdog</h1>
                <p class="description">The Shetland Sheepdog, often known as the Sheltie, is a breed of herding dog that originated in the Shetland Islands of Scotland. The original name was Shetland Collie, but this caused controversy amongst Rough Collie breeders of the time,
                    so the breed s name was formally changed.<br>This diligent small dog is clever, vocal, excitable and willing to please. They are incredibly trustworthy to their owners to the point where they are often referred to as shadows due to
                    their attachment to family.

                    <div id="more3" class="hidden">This breed was formally recognized by The Kennel Club (UK) in 1909. Like the Shetland pony, Shetland cattle and the Shetland sheep, the Shetland Sheepdog is a hardy but diminutive breed developed to thrive amidst the harsh and meagre
                        conditions of its native islands.<br> While the Sheltie still excels at herding, today it is often raised as a working dog and,or family pet. The Sheltie s origins are obscure, but it is not a direct descendant of the Rough Collie,
                        which it largely resembles.<br> Rather, the Sheltie is a descendant of small specimens of the Scottish Collie and the King Charles Spaniel.<br> They were originally a small mixed-breed dog, often only about 20 to 30 centimetres
                        (8 to 12 inches) in height at the shoulder, and it is thought that the original Shetland herding dogs were of the Spitz type, and were crossed with Collies from mainland Britain.In the early 20th century, James Loggie added a small
                        Rough Collie to the breeding stock, and helped establish the breed that would become the modern Shetland Sheepdog.= </p>

                <p class="description">The Parson Russell Terrier is a breed of small white terrier that was the original Fox Terrier of the 18th century.<br> The breed is named after the Reverend Jack Russell, credited with the creation of this type of dog.<br> It is the recognised
                    conformation show variety of the Jack Russell Terrier and was first recognised in 1990 in the United Kingdom as the Parson Jack Russell Terrier.<br> In America, it was first recognised as the Jack Russell Terrier in 1997. <br>The name
                    was changed to its current form in 1999 in the UK and by 2008 all international kennel clubs recognised it under the new name.<br> A mostly white breed with either a smooth, rough or broken coat, it conforms to a narrower range of
                    sizes than the Jack Russell.<br> It is a feisty, energetic terrier, suited to sports and able to get along with children and other animals. It has a range of breed-related health issues, mainly relating to eye disorders.</p>

                <h1>Crufts</h1>
                <p class="description">Crufts is an international dog show held annually in the UK. <br>Organised and hosted by the Kennel Club, it is the largest show of its kind in the world. Crufts is primarily focused on international dog shows, with 20,000 dogs competing
                    for the world s Best in Show title, but there are also over 500 dog-themed stands (like the Paris Horse Show), as well as agility, obedience, flyball and other competitions.<br> The Cruft was born in the UK by Charles Cruft (so you
                    know where the name comes from) Charles Cruft.
                    <button id="read4">Read more ...</button>

                    <div id="more4" class="hidden"> In 1891 the first show called Crufts Cruft s Greatest Dog Show was held. <br>It was the first show where all breeds of dogs were invited to compete (this first show had about 2,000 dogs and about 2,500 entries). <br>By the end of the
                        19th century, entries had risen to over 3,000.<br> In the following years the Cruft continued and gained popularity, until Charles death in 1938.<br> His wife ran the event for four years until she stopped, as the responsibility
                        was too great and tiring, and sold it to the Kennel Club in 1942. <br>In 1948 the first cruft run by the Kennel Club took place in London, and it continued to grow in popularity year on year.
                        <br> In 1950 the BBC televised the show. The cruft had to be moved several times due to the number of visitors and therefore the space for the cruft had to be bigger. <br>Since 1991 the show has been held at the National Exhibition
                        Centre, Solihull.
                        <br> That same year the Crufts was officially recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as the largest dog show in the world with 22,973 dogs exhibited that year. <br>Including other events, it is estimated that an average of
                        28,000 dogs attend Crufts each year, with around 160,000 visitors. <br>In 2008, the BBC stopped broadcasting the Cruft. <br>The Kennel Club was criticised in the BBC programme Pedigree Dogs Exposed for allowing breed standards,
                        judging standards and breeding practices that would compromise the health of pedigree dogs.<br> The programme led to several sponsors pulling out.<br> Since 2010, the show has been broadcast on the commercial channels Channel 4
                        and More4 , attracting over 4.5 million viewers.</p>
